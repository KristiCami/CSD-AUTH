# CSD-AUTH

This repository contains a selection of the projects I completed during my Bachelor’s degree in Informatics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. While it includes only a portion of my university work, the projects featured here reflect my exploration of various topics, from software development to algorithmic problem-solving.

Please note that not all projects have detailed README files. Some include reports, which are available in a mix of formats such as DOC and PDF, with a few also written in LaTeX (in Greek). These documents provide insights into the development process, key challenges, and the technical solutions implemented.

Although this collection doesn’t cover every project from my degree, it showcases some of the most significant and interesting work I completed during my studies.

Feel free to browse through the projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
